    * The strategy pattern belongs to the group of behavioral patterns.
    * This abstract coupling provides a useful fiction of more theoretical components working together to be realized later on
    *       without your code knowing the actual implementation.
    * Strategies are using this decoupled code style to create interchangeable small logic units based on an identical abstraction.
    *       Which one is chosen is decided at runtime.
