        Structural Design Patterns
           How to compose objects to form larger or enhanced objects.

        focus on designing maintainable and flexible source code for objects created.
        Structural patterns attempt to bring clarity to relationships between created instances,
        not only to maintain an application but also to easily understand its purpose.

        The primary motivation for using behavior patterns is transparent communication between objects,
            or in other words, the efficient usage of memory allocation for this communication.

        Utilizing behavioral patterns improves the flexibility of communication and
            helps complete a task with a single object or multiple objects exchanging information with each other.

        Limiting expensive initialization using the caching pattern
        Standardizing processes with the template pattern
        Turning information into action with the command pattern
