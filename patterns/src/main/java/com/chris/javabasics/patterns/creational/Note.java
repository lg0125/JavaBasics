     *  Creational Design Patterns
     *      How to abstract the object creation/instantiation process, to help create, compose, and represent objects.
     *
     *  Applying the factory method pattern
     *      Instantiating additional factories in encapsulation with the abstract factory pattern
     *      Creating a different configuration of object instances with the builder pattern
     *      Avoiding a repeatedly complex configuration with the prototype pattern
     *      Examining only one instance presence with the singleton pattern
     *      Speeding up runtime with prepared objects by using the object pool pattern
     *      Controlling instances on demand with the lazy initialization pattern
     *      Reducing the object instances with the dependency injection pattern
